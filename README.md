# Marketing A/B Testing

We used the marketing A/B testing dataset designed to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by comparing two groups:
- Experimental group exposed to ads.
- Control group exposed to Public Service Announcements (PSAs) or nothing.

### Goals:

- Determine Campaign Success: Analyze if ad exposure significantly increases conversions compared to the control group.
- Quantify Ad Impact: Measure how much of the success can be attributed to the ads and evaluate if the observed differences are statistically significant.

### Findings:

- The campaign is a success, with ads significantly boosting conversion rates compared to PSAs (Relative Lift: 43.09%, P-value: 0.00000).
- The increase in conversions is proven to result from the ads, not random chance.
- A substantial lift demonstrates the strong impact of the campaign.

### Recommendations:

- Expand: Reach more people by scaling the campaign and focusing on peak impact times.
- Optimize: Refine ad content and design based on the best-performing ads.
- Segment: Analyze the impact of ads on different demographics to tailor strategies.
- Monitor: Continuously track conversion rates and test new ad approaches.
- Reallocate: Shift budget from PSAs to ads to maximize conversion gains.
